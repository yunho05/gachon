# My Project Plan 
**Note**: This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide
  
  any working guide to an actual project
### Proposal
***
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.   
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko,"LInK")   
or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/"LInk"), and other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection,"link"):

### Dependencies
* python
* opencv-python
* tensorflow
*  openmmlab
*  package manager

### Installation
 In a bash terminal, run the following commands (Do NOT actually run these commands in   
your computer):

<pre><code>
$ sudo apt update 
$ conda create -n cv_detection 
$ conda activate cv_detection 
$ python --version 
$ python example.py
</code></pre>
